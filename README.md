# ictv
A versioned copy of Main Species List (MSL) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in various formats.

https://ictv.global/msl contains XLSX versions of the MSL published by ICTV. 

This repository derives ictv.tsv ictv.csv etc from "current" versions as published via https://ictv.global/msl/current using [Preston](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston), a biodiversity data tracker. 

With this, the "current" MSL are versioned (aka a version hash), and their provenance (origin) is captured. 

The MSL itself licensed under CC-BY-SA, and the derived products are licensed as CC0. However, when using this data, please cite the ICTV: they've done most of the hard work.
